# SkillzMe - Tokenized Skill Verification System

A decentralized platform for verifying and tokenizing skills through community-reviewed assessments. Built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

The Tokenized Skill Verification System enables:
- Creation of verifiable skill definitions
- Peer-reviewed skill verification process
- NFT-based skill badges
- Decentralized governance of verification criteria

## Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) installed
- Node.js v14+ for testing environment
- Basic understanding of Clarity and Stacks blockchain

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/skill-verification-system
cd skill-verification-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Initialize Clarinet project:
```bash
clarinet new
```

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### skill-verification.clar
Main contract handling skill verification and NFT minting:

- **Data Maps**:
    - `skills`: Stores skill definitions and requirements
    - `skill-verifications`: Tracks verification requests and status
    - `governance-parameters`: System configuration parameters

- **NFT Implementation**:
    - `skill-badge`: Non-fungible token representing verified skills
    - Automated minting upon successful verification

### Core Functions

1. Skill Management:
```clarity
(create-skill (name (string-ascii 64)) 
             (description (string-ascii 256)) 
             (required-votes uint))
```

2. Verification Process:
```clarity
(request-verification (skill-id uint))
(vote-on-verification (skill-id uint) (user principal) (approve bool))
```

3. Query Functions:
```clarity
(get-skill (skill-id uint))
(get-verification-status (skill-id uint) (user principal))
```

## Usage

### Creating a New Skill

```clarity
(contract-call? .skill-verification create-skill 
    "Smart Contract Development"
    "Ability to write and deploy smart contracts"
    u3)
```

### Requesting Verification

```clarity
(contract-call? .skill-verification request-verification u1)
```

### Voting on Verification

```clarity
(contract-call? .skill-verification vote-on-verification 
    u1 
    'SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7 
    true)
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
clarinet test
```

Test cases cover:
- Skill creation
- Verification requests
- Voting process
- NFT minting
- Governance parameter updates

## Governance

The system includes decentralized governance features:

- **Modifiable Parameters**:
    - Minimum required validators
    - Approval threshold percentage
    - Required votes for verification

- **Parameter Updates**:
  ```clarity
  (map-set governance-parameters 
      { parameter: "min-validators" } 
      { value: u3 })
  ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Vote Manipulation Prevention**:
    - One vote per validator
    - Immutable vote records
    - Minimum validator threshold

2. **Access Control**:
    - Skill creation restricted to contract owner
    - Verification requests limited to one per user per skill

3. **Data Integrity**:
    - Non-modifiable skill definitions
    - Permanent badge records
    - Transparent verification history

## Best Practices

1. **For Skill Creators**:
    - Provide clear, specific skill descriptions
    - Set appropriate validator requirements
    - Consider skill prerequisites

2. **For Validators**:
    - Review verification evidence thoroughly
    - Maintain consistent evaluation criteria
    - Declare any conflicts of interest

3. **For Users**:
    - Submit comprehensive verification evidence
    - Allow sufficient time for validation
    - Maintain transparency in skill claims
